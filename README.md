## Project Overview
This repository contains group coursework for **7CS518 – Business Analytics (MSc Big Data Analytics, University of Derby, 2025)**.  
The project focuses on the **design and implementation of a Predictive MIS (Management Information System) for Loan Approval Decisions** using **SAS** for statistical modelling and **Power BI** for data storytelling.

## Objectives
- Preprocess and analyse a loan dataset of 45,000 applications.
- Build a logistic regression model in SAS to predict loan approval outcomes.
- Handle class imbalance and outlier treatment for fairer predictions.
- Translate statistical results into business insights.
- Develop interactive Power BI dashboards to visualise approval patterns.
